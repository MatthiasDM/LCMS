# What

The LCMS is a digital system that allows flexible management of information about the laboratory that falls outside the LIS target area. 

From my own practical experience I know that a software package for this is hard to find, and often cannot fully meet the needs of the lab. The lack of functionalities and flexibility is the reason why I started this project.

To start with, there is a very big plus: it is free and can be adapted and used by everyone.

The three largest functionalities that will be further developed first are:

A document management system: a system in which the documents are subject to extensive control before they become official. These documents must be reviewed periodically and the changes are fully traceable.
A non-compliance system: a system in which events are noted that do not conform to the normal or intended functioning of a system. In this system, all incidents are followed up and submitted to a responsible person for approval before they receive a completed status.
A competence management system: a system in which all competencies (~ what and who may perform something) of the employees can be managed.
Other functionalities can certainly be added. I am thinking, for example, of an eHealthBox that allows secure communication between labs, a stock management system, ...

# For whom

The software is written in the context of a clinical laboratory, but actually applies to every laboratory. Because this project is open source, anyone who wants to copy and modify this project can. One can also help to develop it.

# Where to obtain

The full project can be found at https://github.com/MatthiasDM/LCMS.

To get started with this project a number of other (free) software packages are needed:

JDK 8 or higher
MongoDB: the database software
Netbeans: the IDE (development environment) in which this project is written
#Development
This project is in full development and is therefore subject to change. Functionalities can be created, updated or even deleted.

Software packages must, certainly in a laboratory, be validated and verified. Due to the transparent nature of this project, all source code can be found on Github. The task of validating and verifying falls on the shoulders of the end user. This does not necessarily mean that all users will have to validate the same. Once a user has validated a certain functionality, he has the option to share his work with others who use the exact same code for the same purpose.
